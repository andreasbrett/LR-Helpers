# LR-Helpers
a few tiny CMDlets to make life easier in Adobe Lightroom

## Requirements
EXIFtool: http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
OpenInWhatever: http://www.robcole.com/Rob/ProductsAndServices/OpenInWhateverLrPlugin

## How to use
These CMDlets can be used from within Adobe Lightroom using the great Lightroom plugin OpenInWhatever by Rob Cole. You can also drag and drop several files onto the CMDlets if you want to use them outside of Lightroom.

Please note that these CMDlets are totally customized to fit MY needs. To make it fit YOUR needs simply modify it to your liking.

## ManualLens.cmd
When shooting adapted/manual lenses there's no electronic exchange between the lens and the camera resulting in photos with missing lens EXIF data. To incorporate this afterwards use ManualLens.cmd and you will be asked which lens data you want to put into the photos. To include further lenses (the script includes only those lenses I own for obvious reasons) please modify it to your needs. It's really straightforward.

## FakeCameraModel.cmd
I needed to fake the camera's model in my Fuji X100s and X-E2 photos' EXIF data in order to get some features in Adobe Lightroom that is only available to some specific Fuji camera models (thanks Adobe for supping with devil). With FakeCameraModel I can e.g. easily turn my X100s photos into X100T photos (EXIF-wise of course) to use the Classic Chrome film profile within Adobe Lightroom. I bet there will come a time when the X-T1 will have new film profiles that the X-E2 won't get so I also added this option in FakeCameraModel.cmd. To include further camera models (the script includes only those cameras I own for obvious reasons) please modify it to your needs. It's really straightforward.
